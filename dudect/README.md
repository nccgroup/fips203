An example constant-time workbench. It can be sensitive to config/defaults, so is
not entirely definitive. A work in progress.

See <https://docs.rs/dudect-bencher/latest/dudect_bencher/>

> t-values greater than 5 are generally considered a good indication that the function is not constant time. t-values less than 5 does not necessarily imply that the function is constant-time, since there may be other input distributions under which the function behaves significantly differently.
